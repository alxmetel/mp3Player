This is one of my first serious projects on Java - "MP3-Player".
It is written on Java, using Swing.
I have uploaded it to GitHub entirely, unfortunately not showing all the stages of development.

So, my Mp3-player has such functionality:

1. It can play mp3-s, pause, stop;
2. It can wing songs;
3. It adjusts and mutes the volume;
4. It has functional playlist;
5. You can add songs there, remove them;
6. You can save your playlist and then open it;
7. Player can search for the songs through your playlist;
8. And also my player can change skins.

Enjoy!
